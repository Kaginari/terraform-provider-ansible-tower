# ansible-tower_inventory

`ansible-tower_inventory` An Inventory is a collection of hosts against which jobs may be launched, the same as an Ansible inventory file. Inventories are divided into groups and these groups contain the actual hosts. Groups may be sourced manually, by entering host names into Tower, or from one of Ansible Towerâ€™s supported cloud providers.

## Example Usage

```hcl

variable "db_pwd" {
  description = "database pwd passed as var to inventory"
}

resource "ansible-tower_inventory" "default" {
  name            = "acc-test"
  organisation_id = "1"
  inv_var {
    key = "database_user"
    value = "root"
  }
  inv_var {
    key = "database_pwd"
    value = var.db_pwd
  }
}
```

## Example Usage with  organisation

```hcl
data "ansible-tower_organization" "example" {
  name = "example"
}

resource "ansible-tower_inventory" "example" {
  name            = "acc-test"
  organisation_id = data.ansible-tower_organization.example.id
  inv_var {
    key = "example_key"
    value = "value_value"
  }
}
```
